        <p>Several different security issues and challenges around web application security has continued to attract attention as a result of increase in the number of hackers and attackers. To discuss a few among these web application menace according to OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities, are;</p>
        <h1>Broken authentication:</h1>
        <p>Is one major vulnerability that attackers have always exploit to gain access to individual or company users account due to negligence on the part of some users. The campaign for authentication protection and strong password for users has been a consistent effort in so many quarters in order to encourage system users to have a strong authentication method so as to protect their account or system from being attack. A web application can suffer broken authentication if the web application become vulnerable when; it allows automated attacks like credential stuffing, weak for brute force, using weak password recovery method, use weak encrypted method and so on.</p>
        <h1>Sensitive data exposure:</h1>
        <p>Is another widespread web application security challenge. A lot of system users both as individual or as organization have directly or indirectly, knowingly or unintentionally exposed their sensitive data some of which includes; credit card details, private credential, medical information, social security numbers etc., on web and this has given attackers the opportunity to manipulate peoples data and give rise to identity theft.</p>

        <h1>Broken access control:</h1>
        <p>This type of web application vulnerabilities is also a major concern and challenges to especially companies. For many years, some companies allow visitors to its website administrative panel and database through login page. This type of implementation approach has exposed many companies to danger and open up its storage to attacks.</p>
        <h1>"Essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications":</h1>
        <p>There are certain measure that can be put in place to ensure web application security. Some few approaches are discussed below.</p>
        <p>
            A multi factor authentication is a good way to strengthen account security.
            A single authentication had been seen not to be a good method, since two-factor
            solution is proving better and it can be made even more than two factors. A cross site forgery can be prevented if web developer and programmers explore
            more of cryptographic token usage which user will use and require to re authenticate
            before completing any form of transaction
        </p>
        <p>
            Password change security design is another way to minimize attacks and discourage
            attackers from attacking an account or a system. If a system is deployed with
            identity validation and security questions by sending a generated token to user
            via out-of-band method and requesting user to verify with enforcing a logout policy.

        </p>
        <p>
            Secure password storage will ensure to protect account from vulnerability especially
            SQL injection and brute force. To combine several major techniques such as a one-way
            algorithm, use a salt encryption method and to use algorithm which is purposely slow.
            This approach can actually reduce drastically attacks on the web application

        </p>
        <p>
            Query parameterization technique is another step that can prevent SQL injection
            vulnerability. Developers needs to prevent untrusted input pretending as
            statement and could be interpreted as syntax for SQL command.
