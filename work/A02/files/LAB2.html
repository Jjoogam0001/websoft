        <h2> LAB 2 QUESTIONAIRE</h2>
        <pre> Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
  I didnt have any experinces in HTML or javascript but i have quite used css in my few projects 
  during the course.

Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.
HTML defines a layout of webpages i.e defines the structure of a webpage, CSS gives graphical outlook to the already defined HTML structure
,While Javascript works with the back end functionality and responsiveness of a web application.
Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.
Web browsers and servers communicate using TCP/IP. Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the standard application protocol on 
top of TCP/IP supporting web browser requests and server responses.
This works in this way;
1.A web client specifies a URL in a browser.
2.The browser initiates a TCP connection to the web server or server pool (using port 80 by default) through its IP address
as published in DNS
3.After the server completes acknowledgment of its side of the TCP connection, the browser sends HTTP requests to the server 
to retrieve the content
4.After the server replies with content for the page, the browser retrieves it from the HTTP packets and displays it 
accordingly

NOTE:
Any errors encountered during the request for the content might be shown as HTTP status lines.
